# Hey, I'm Chakshan.

I'm an undergraduate student at **UCSD** studying **Computer Science**. I am currently interested in the *software*  and *intelligence* side of **robotics**. I love learning new things and working on cool projects with cool people. Here is an external link to [something interesting I've been reading about](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/gr00t).



## Languages
The following are the programming languages I am most experienced in ranked from most expertise to least:

## Goals
For this quarter and the remaining year, I hope to accomplish the following goals:
- [ ] Become more cognizant of ensuing developments in computing and robotics by reading articles and news stories every day
- [ ] Complete an end-to-end project in software to develop my skills in software engineering
- [ ] Write and submit a research paper as a part of lab conducting research in imitation learning for robotics
- [x] Write this goals list :)

## Leisure & Hobbies
These are some activities I enjoy doing in my free time:
